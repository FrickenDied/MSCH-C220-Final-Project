# Drunken Genius
MSCH-C220 Game Jam, December 2024

## Theme
The theme was reverse and the way that we wanted to interpret the theme was by telling a story in pieces backwards.

## Gameplay
The objective was to solve a set of point and click sorting puzzles while navigating a house. 

Use WASD to move 4 directionally and E while red to interact with something.
 
## Impediments
The biggest problems we ran into were time management and scale, scale doesn't necessarily mean we had plans of making a massive game but it likely was too big for 4 beginner game devs to undertake. While everybody was able to put something together on their own, we did not leave enough time to be able to wrap everything together into a single experience. I will add for myself (Samuel Styer) another big issue was lack of knowledge and not asking for enough help. While I was able to make some basic stuff, I underestimated how little I knew about making the game we had in mind. Finally I'll add that we maybe could have communicated with each other better as at the end we were missing crucial pieces like the setting.

## Implementation

A character that can move in 4 directions using WASD
Multiple scenes and a system that lets the player choose to switch scenes if in a designated area
SFX and background music
Sprites both handcrafted and scavenged
